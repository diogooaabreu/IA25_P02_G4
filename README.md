## Project Overview
This project focuses on the application of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** techniques to sports data, specifically analyzing the historical dataset of NFL Super Bowl games (1967–2020).  
The goal is to explore the dataset, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and apply machine learning techniques for:

1. Automatic Classification — Predict game outcomes or categories (e.g., high scoring games, competitive games).
2. Clustering — Group similar Super Bowl games based on features to discover patterns.
3. Association Rules — Identify frequent relationships between game variables (e.g., points, teams, MVPs, locations).

## Deliverables
The project includes:

1. **Notebook 0 – Dataset Overview & EDA**  
   - Introduction, dataset description, metadata, and exploratory data analysis.
   - Submitted as the **preliminary delivery**.

2. **Notebook 1 – Automatic Classification**  
   - Definition of business goals, data preparation, feature engineering, algorithm selection, model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.

3. **Notebook 2 – Clustering**  
   - Data preparation, application of K-Means, analysis of cluster characteristics, and evaluation.

4. **Notebook 3 – Association Rules**  
   - Data preparation, application of Apriori algorithm, analysis of discovered rules, and interpretation.

5. **Other files**  
   - Dataset (`superbowl.csv`)
   - Any helper scripts or required files to run the notebooks.

## Notes
- All notebooks are compatible with **VS Code / Jupyter Notebook**.
- Required Python libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `mlxtend`.
- All notebooks are self-contained and include markdown explanations for each step.
