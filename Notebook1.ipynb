    "\n",
    "This notebook focuses on the application of **automatic classification techniques** to the historical Olympic athletes dataset covering the period from **1896 to 2016**. Building upon the exploratory data analysis (EDA) conducted previously, this notebook aims to transform the available data into a predictive framework using supervised machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains detailed information about athletes, events, and Olympic results, allowing the identification of patterns related to athlete characteristics, sports, and competition contexts. By leveraging these features, classification models are trained to predict **medal outcomes** in Olympic events.\n",

    "\n",
    "Using historical data from the Olympic Games (1896–2016), this analysis aims to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build supervised machine learning models to classify **whether an athlete wins a medal or not**, based on features such as age, sex, physical attributes, sport, season, and country.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Optimize the selected model through hyperparameter tuning in order to improve predictive performance.\n",

The selected algorithms were chosen based on their popularity, interpretability, and suitability for classification tasks involving both numerical and categorical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression is used as a **baseline classification model**. Despite its simplicity, it is a widely adopted algorithm for binary classification problems and provides easily interpretable results.\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm models the probability of an athlete winning a medal as a function of the input features. It is particularly useful for understanding the influence of individual variables on the target outcome and serves as a reference point for comparing more complex models.\n",

    "**Key characteristics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simple and computationally efficient\n",
    "\n",
    "- Suitable for binary classification\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provides interpretable coefficients\n",

    "\n",
    "The Decision Tree classifier is a non-linear model that splits the dataset into subsets based on feature values, creating a tree-like structure of decisions. It is capable of capturing complex relationships between features without requiring extensive data preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees are intuitive and easy to visualize, making them useful for explaining classification decisions. However, they are prone to overfitting if not properly constrained.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Handles both numerical and categorical data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Easy to interpret and visualize\n",
    "\n",
    "- Captures non-linear relationships\n",

    "- Prone to overfitting without pruning or depth control\n",

    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Random Forest Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "The Random Forest classifier is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple Decision Trees to improve classification performance and robustness. By aggregating the predictions of several trees, Random Forest reduces overfitting and improves generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm is particularly well-suited for complex datasets such as Olympic results, where interactions between multiple features may influence medal outcomes.\n",

    "\n",
    "- High predictive performance\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduces overfitting through ensemble learning\n",

    "\n",
    "The target variable used in this classification task is `Medal`, which represents the outcome of an athlete in a specific Olympic event.\n",

    "For the purposes of this notebook, the target variable was transformed into a **binary classification** problem:\n",

    "\n",
    "- `0` – The athlete did not win a medal\n",

    "\n",
    "The following features were selected as input variables based on their relevance to athlete performance and medal outcomes:\n",

    "- **Age** – Represents the athlete’s age at the time of the competition\n",

    "- **Sex** – Biological sex of the athlete (Male or Female)\n",

    "- **Height** – Athlete’s height in centimeters\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Handling Missing Values**  \n",
    "   Some numerical features such as `Age`, `Height`, and `Weight` contain missing values.  \n",
    "   To maintain data quality, we fill missing values using the median for each sex category, which provides a more accurate representation than a global median.\n",

    "## 9.4. Random Forest Optimization (Quick Version)\n",
    "\n",
    "After comparing the baseline and improved Random Forest models, we aim to further enhance performance through **hyperparameter optimization**. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Improve recall for medal-winning athletes while maintaining good overall accuracy.\n",
    "- Tune the following hyperparameters:\n",
    "  - `n_estimators`: Number of trees in the forest\n",
    "  - `max_depth`: Maximum depth of each tree\n",
    "  - `criterion`: Function to measure the quality of a split (`gini` or `entropy`)\n",
    "  - `class_weight`: Address class imbalance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RandomizedSearchCV** is used instead of GridSearchCV for a faster search.\n",
    "- 10 random combinations of the hyperparameters are evaluated.\n",
    "- 3-fold cross-validation is applied on the training set.\n",
    "- The model is evaluated on the test set using **accuracy**, **confusion matrix**, and **classification report**.\n",
    "- Confusion matrix is visualized using a heatmap for easier interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach helps to find a well-performing Random Forest model without performing an exhaustive search, reducing computational time while improving predictive power for the minority class (medalists).\n"

    "In this notebook, we developed a machine learning pipeline to automatically predict whether an athlete wins a medal in the Olympic Games based on historical data from 1896 to 2016. The process included data cleaning, handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and splitting the dataset into training and test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "We applied several classification algorithms—Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest (including optimized versions)—and evaluated their performance with a particular focus on the recall for medal-winning athletes, given the strong class imbalance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Findings:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Class imbalance is a critical factor**: Models trained without considering the imbalance (e.g., baseline Random Forest, Logistic Regression) showed high overall accuracy but very poor ability to identify medalists.  \n",
    "- **Decision Tree and Random Forest models** handle complex interactions better, improving recall for medal winners.  \n",
    "- **Class balancing and hyperparameter optimization** in Random Forest significantly enhanced the identification of medalists while maintaining reasonable overall accuracy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall Recommendation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimized Random Forest model achieves the best balance between precision, recall, and overall accuracy. It demonstrates that ensemble methods with careful tuning are the most effective for predicting medal outcomes in highly imbalanced datasets like the Olympic athletes dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "These results provide a strong foundation for future analysis, such as feature importance exploration, predicting specific medal types, or incorporating additional athlete and event features to improve model performance.\n"
