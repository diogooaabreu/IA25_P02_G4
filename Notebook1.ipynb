    "\n",
    "This notebook focuses on the application of **automatic classification techniques** to the historical Olympic athletes dataset covering the period from **1896 to 2016**. Building upon the exploratory data analysis (EDA) conducted previously, this notebook aims to transform the available data into a predictive framework using supervised machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains detailed information about athletes, events, and Olympic results, allowing the identification of patterns related to athlete characteristics, sports, and competition contexts. By leveraging these features, classification models are trained to predict **medal outcomes** in Olympic events.\n",

    "\n",
    "Using historical data from the Olympic Games (1896–2016), this analysis aims to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build supervised machine learning models to classify **whether an athlete wins a medal or not**, based on features such as age, sex, physical attributes, sport, season, and country.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compare the performance of different classification algorithms and identify the most suitable model for this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Optimize the selected model through hyperparameter tuning in order to improve predictive performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provide insights into which athlete and competition features are most relevant for medal prediction.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this notebook, several **supervised machine learning classification algorithms** are applied and compared in order to predict Olympic medal outcomes. The selected algorithms were chosen based on their popularity, interpretability, and suitability for classification tasks involving both numerical and categorical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression is used as a **baseline classification model**. Despite its simplicity, it is a widely adopted algorithm for binary classification problems and provides easily interpretable results.\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm models the probability of an athlete winning a medal as a function of the input features. It is particularly useful for understanding the influence of individual variables on the target outcome and serves as a reference point for comparing more complex models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key characteristics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simple and computationally efficient\n",
    "\n",
    "- Suitable for binary classification\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provides interpretable coefficients\n",

    "- Sensitive to feature scaling and multicollinearity\n",

    "### 4.2 Decision Tree Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "The Decision Tree classifier is a non-linear model that splits the dataset into subsets based on feature values, creating a tree-like structure of decisions. It is capable of capturing complex relationships between features without requiring extensive data preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees are intuitive and easy to visualize, making them useful for explaining classification decisions. However, they are prone to overfitting if not properly constrained.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key characteristics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handles both numerical and categorical data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Easy to interpret and visualize\n",
    "\n",
    "- Captures non-linear relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prone to overfitting without pruning or depth control\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Random Forest Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "The Random Forest classifier is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple Decision Trees to improve classification performance and robustness. By aggregating the predictions of several trees, Random Forest reduces overfitting and improves generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm is particularly well-suited for complex datasets such as Olympic results, where interactions between multiple features may influence medal outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key characteristics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- High predictive performance\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduces overfitting through ensemble learning\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handles large datasets and feature interactions well\n",

    "\n",
    "### 5.1 Target Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "The target variable used in this classification task is `Medal`, which represents the outcome of an athlete in a specific Olympic event.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this notebook, the target variable was transformed into a **binary classification** problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `1` – The athlete won a medal (Gold, Silver, or Bronze)\n",
    "\n",
    "- `0` – The athlete did not win a medal\n",
    "\n",
    "This transformation simplifies the classification task, reduces class imbalance issues, and provides a more stable foundation for model training and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2 Selected Features\n",
    "\n",
    "The following features were selected as input variables based on their relevance to athlete performance and medal outcomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Age** – Represents the athlete’s age at the time of the competition\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sex** – Biological sex of the athlete (Male or Female)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Height** – Athlete’s height in centimeters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Weight** – Athlete’s weight in kilograms\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sport** – Type of sport in which the athlete competed\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Season** – Olympic season (Summer or Winter)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Year** – Year of the Olympic Games\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NOC** – National Olympic Committee code, representing the athlete’s country\n",
    "\n",
    "These variables capture **demographic, physical, temporal, and contextual** aspects that are likely to influence athletic performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.3 Excluded Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Several attributes were excluded from the modeling process due to limited predictive value or potential issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ID** – Unique identifier with no relevance for prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Name** – High-cardinality textual feature, not suitable for generalization\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Team** – Redundant with the NOC attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Games** – Combination of year and season, redundant with existing features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **City** – High cardinality and low relevance to individual performance\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Event** – Very high cardinality, which could introduce noise and sparsity\n",
