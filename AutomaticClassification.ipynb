    "# Notebook 1 — Automatic Classification\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "> This first notebook of Project 02 focuses on the application of **automatic classification** techniques to sports data, using a historical dataset of NFL Super Bowl games.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The main goal of this notebook is to develop machine learning models capable of **classifying a Super Bowl game** based on defined criteria, such as:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - predicting whether the winning team scored above a certain threshold;\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - classifying games as competitive or one-sided;\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - predicting categories related to game performance based on available variables.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> This notebook demonstrates the ability to apply supervised machine learning methods, prepare data for classification, compare multiple algorithms, and interpret model results in a real sports context.\n",
